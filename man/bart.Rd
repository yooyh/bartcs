\arguments{
\item{Y}{A vector of outcome values.}

\item{trt}{A vector of treatment values. Binary treatment works for both model
and continuous treatment works for single_bart(). For binary treatment,
use 1 to indicate the treated group and 0 for the control group.}

\item{X}{A matrix of potential confounders.}

\item{trt_treated}{Value of \code{trt} for the treated group.
The default value is set to 1.}

The default value is set to 0.}

\item{num_tree}{Number of trees in BART model. The default value is set to 100.}

\item{num_chain}{Number of MCMC chains.
Need to set \code{num_chain > 1} for the Gelman-Rubin diagnostic.
The default value is set to 4.}

\item{num_burn_in}{Number of MCMC samples to be discarded per chain
as initial burn-in periods.
The default value is set to 100.}

\item{num_thin}{Number of thinning per chain.
One in every \code{num_thin} samples are selected.
The default value is set to 1.}

\item{num_post_sample}{Final number of posterior samples per chain.
Number of MCMC iterations per chain is
\code{burn_in + num_thin * num_post_sample}.
The default value is set to 100.}

\item{step_prob}{A vector of tree alteration probabilities (GROW, PRUNE, CHANGE).
Each alteration is proposed to change the tree structure. \cr
The default setting is \verb{(0.28, 0.28, 0.44)}.}

\item{alpha, beta}{Hyperparameters for tree regularization prior.
A terminal node of depth \code{d} will split with
probability of \code{alpha * (1 + d)^(-beta)}. \cr
The default setting is
\verb{(alpha, beta) = (0.95, 2)} from Chipman et al. (2010).}

\item{nu, q}{Values to calibrate hyperparameter of sigma prior. \cr
The default setting is \verb{(nu, q) = (3, 0.95)} from Chipman et al. (2010).}

\item{dir_alpha}{Hyperparameter of Dirichlet prior for selection probabilities.
The default value is 5.}

\item{parallel}{If \code{TRUE}, model fitting will be parallelized
with respect to \code{N = nrow(X)}.
Parallelization is recommended for very high \code{n} only.
The default setting is FALSE.}

\item{verbose}{If \code{TRUE}, message will be printed during training.
If \code{FALSE}, message will be suppressed.}

\description{
Fit Bayesian Regression Additive Trees (BART) models
to select relevant confounders among a large set of potential confounders
and to estimate average treatment effect \eqn{E[Y(1) - Y(0)]}.
}
\details{
\code{separate_bart()} and \code{single_bart()} fit an exposure model and outcome model(s)
for estimating treatment effect with adjustment of confounders
in the presence of a large set of potential confounders (Kim et al. 2023).

The exposure model \eqn{E[A|X]} and the outcome model(s) \eqn{E[Y|A,X]} are
linked together with a common Dirichlet prior that accrues
posterior selection probabilities to the corresponding confounders (\eqn{X})
on the basis of association with both the exposure (\eqn{A}) and the
outcome (\eqn{Y}).

There is a distinction between fitting separate outcome models for the treated
and control groups and fitting a single outcome model for both groups.
\itemize{
\item \code{separate_bart()} specifies two \strong{"separate"} outcome models
for two binary treatment levels.
Thus, it fits three models:
one exposure model and two separate outcome models for \eqn{A = 0, 1}.

\item \code{single_bart()} specifies one \strong{"single"} outcome model.
Thus, it fits two models:
one exposure model and one outcome model for the entire sample.
}

All inferences are made with outcome model(s).
